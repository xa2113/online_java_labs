/**
 * Objects, Classes and Methods Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Create three classes, all of which can be inside this file. The first class (the controller)
 *      should have the main method. The main method should create at least two objects using the
 *      constructors of the second and third class. The second and third class should each have at least
 *      three instance variables that should be set using the constructor when an object is created.
 *
 *      Once the objects are created, try changing the values of some of the instance variables.
 *
 *      Think about some of the examples we have seen from the lectures or Confluence Docs.
 *
 *      Be creative. Have some fun. Using Java objects you can model just about anything you want.
 *      Cars, animals, poker games, sports teams, trees, beers, people and so on.
