Answer the following questions:


1.) What is an instance variable?
An instance variable is a member data of a class.

2.) How do you create an object of a class Vehicle?
Vehicle object_name = new Vehicle();

3.) What is a reference variable? How is it different from a primitive type?
A reference variable is an object being passed from one method to another. This differs from a primitive type in that,
when a primitive type is passed from methodA() to methodB(), methodB() now has a copy of that primitive variable that it can make any changes to without changing that variable in methodA().

4.) What does it mean to pass by reference?
public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Car car1 = new Car("Blue", "Nissan", "XTerra");

        // car2 is not a new object - it is a reference to car1 - any changes you make to car2 WILL affect car1
        Car car2 = car1;

        // set car2 color to Green - this WILL affect car1
        car2.setColor("Green");

        // print the color of car1
        System.out.println(car1.getColor());
        // "Green" will print
    }
}

This shows when car2 is assigned a color, and car2 is passed to car1, car1 now has that same color.

5.) What makes up a method signature?
access-modifier return-type method-name(param a, param b, ...){
}

6.) Write a method signature for a method divide() that takes two ints as parameters and returns a double.


7.) When does a method stop executing? How can you make it terminate?

8.) How do you return a String from a method?

9.) What is the return type of a method that does not returns any value?

10.) When should a method be static?

11.) What is an example of a time you would make an instance variable static? final?

12.) When a method returns a value, what needs to be done with that value?

13.) What is method overloading?

14.) Demonstrate method overloading by writing the method signature of two overloaded methods.

14.) What are constructors used for?

15.) If a class does not have a constructor, how does Java handle the creation of an object

16.) What does a constructor that takes in two variable, make and model, for a class Vehicle look like?

17.) What is the "this" keyword used for?

18.) What are the keywords public, private, protected used for in a class declaration? A method declaration? Variable declaration?

19.) What is constructor overloading?

20.) Demonstrate constructor overloading with three overloaded constructors.
