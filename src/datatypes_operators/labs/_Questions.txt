Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?
Boolean - True or False
Char - character
byte - integer with 8 bits
short - a unicode character
int - an integer value (max of 32 bits)
long - an integer value (only whole numbers; 64 bits)
float - floating point number (32 bits)
double - floating point number (64 bits)

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
int x = 42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
The variable would lose date -> narrowing casting

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
Widening casting - directly declare the integer as a double; no explicit casting needed.

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
Relational operators are used to compare number values. The result evaluates to a boolean value.

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
1>2 --> true.

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
Logical operators evaluate two booleans. The result evaluates to a boolean value.

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
int x = 4;
if(x=3)|(x=4);
--> true.

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
x +=10;

11.) What data type is a String?
Strings is an object.

12.) Are string mutable?
No. You can't change them after they have been created.

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?
with the "+" sign.

14.) Can you cast an int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?
Yes. by using integer.toString(int i).

15.) What is an array?
An array is a collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name.

16.) What is the first index of an array?
0

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?
Yes.

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?
exampleArray[4]

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.
int[] scores = new int[10];
int scores[] = new int[10];

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?
int[][] example = {
    {1,2},
    {2,3,4}
};

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
It is used to iterate over a collection of variables such as arrays.
