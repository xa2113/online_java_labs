Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
Inheritance allows you to create a general class that defines traits common to a set of related items.
This class can then be inherited by other, more specific classes, each adding those things that are unique to it.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
To incorporate one class into another class into its declaration.
answer: -> to avoid redundancy

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
When ClassA defines the general things a Car should have, and ClassB defines what those general things are specifically in sports car's case.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
use the keyword "extend"

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
Infinite.
One class can only extend one other class.

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
The "super" keyword refers to a variable, method or constructor in the parent class.

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
the super class's constructor is executed first.
because the parent object has to exist before the child.

8.) What is method overriding?
By using @override, a child class can override the method defined by the parent class.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
When you want to use the same method differently in the parent class and child class.
