Byte streams are used when you want to read/write data byte by byte (8 bits at a time).

2.) What is a character stream?
Character streams are used when you want to read/write data character by character (16 bits at a time).

3.) What two classes are at the top of the the byte stream hierarchy?
InputStream, OutputStream

4.) What two classes are at the top of the the character stream hierarchy?
Reader, Writer

5.) List at least three byte stream classes.
FileInputStream,
FilterInputStream,
FileOutputStream

6.) List at least three character stream classes.
InputStreamReader,
BufferedReader
FilterWriter

7.) What is a try-with-resources?
???

8.) What makes the BufferedReader different from the BufferedInputStream?
BufferedReader is one of the byte stream classes(8 bits).
BufferredInputStream is one of the character stream classes (16 bits).

9.) When would you use the read() method vs. the readline() method?
The read() method is defined by BufferedReader and can read from the console.
The readline() method is also part of BufferedReader, but reads a string from the keyboard.
