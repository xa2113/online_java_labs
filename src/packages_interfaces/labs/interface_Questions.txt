Answer the following questions:

1.) What is an interface?
An interface defines one or more methods that have no body. Once an interface is defined, any number of classes can implement it.

2.) Why are interfaces implemented?
In order to require all the related classes to have the necessary components.

3.) What is the implement keyword used for?
The implement keyword implements the interface to the related class.

4.) How many interfaces can class implement?
Infinite.

5.) Write a simple interface with one method.
public interface ExampleInterface{
    method();
}

6.) Think of a real world application where interfaces are used. Describe its purpose.
An interface about DailyActivities has the following methods:
- goToSchool();
- doHomework();

A class about Student1 can define the school the student goes to and how Student1 does his/her homework.

7.) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        int sum(int x, int y){
            return x + y;
        }
    }


The methods in an interface should not have a body, unless it is the default interface.
