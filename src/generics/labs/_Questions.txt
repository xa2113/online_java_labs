Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
We use generics to allow our programs to run different data types.

2.) What is type erasure?
Generic type parameters are replaced at compile time by Java. This process is called Type Erasure.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
ArrayList

4.) Can an interface be generic?
Yes.

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
Bound generic types set an upperlimit to the datatype that can be used. Unbound does not have this restriction.
